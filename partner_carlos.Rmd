   + What did the Owner do in the most recent commit? What is the commit ID? 
   add files via upload
   
   + Knit the Owner's `owner_YourName.Rmd`. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you encounter?
   yes i could without error.
   + Also include one tip for making Git/GitHub easier, or an error/difficulty you encountered.

I would recommend spending time playing around with git hub and bash to help you fully understand it.
