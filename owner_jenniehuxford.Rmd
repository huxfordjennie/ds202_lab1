What do you tell people about your field of study at a party? 

I say that statistics isn't as bad as they think. 


What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work? 

1. Writing things down in my planner.

2. Making lists of things I need to do. 

3. Rewriting notes after class more legibly. 

Interesting fact about yourself?

I want to run a half marathon in every state.
